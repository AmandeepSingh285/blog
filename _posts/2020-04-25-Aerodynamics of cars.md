# Aerodynamics of car

Aerodynamics is the study of how fluids, both liquid and gases, react with moving solid body. The two basic forces in aerodynamics are lift and drag. Lift is the perpendicular force, one is the flying kind that is required in planes for creating lift called positive lift, and the other is the negative lift or the downward force which is required to keep the cars grounded on floor than creating a lift which is not preferred in cars. Drag is the force that acts opposite to the direction of moving body. They are of two types, pressure drag and friction drag, the former is created due to pressure difference in air between the rear and front side as more air is piled up at the front, creating high pressure there and low pressure at the rear side.
Air is similar to a liquid, it is just that we cannot see it. Practically, when you are driving, you are moving in an endless ocean that is air ocean. Hence, air creates some friction when an object moves through it, that friction is nothing but drag. So drag is one of the main aerodynamic force, that needs to be avoided for smooth movement, but cannot be avoided as it is directly proportional to the square of velocity and drag area. The vehicles moving at lower speed will have lower drag and the ones moving at high speed will have higher drag that is drag increases exponentially. Meanwhile, drag also depends on drag area which is product of drag coefficient(Cd) and frontal area of the car; lower the drag coefficient, more aerodynamic the object or the shape is. For example, brick has Cd=1 and tear drop with raindrop shape has Cd=0.05 which is more aerodynamic, which is why car’s shape was changed from boxy to almost streamline.

Hence, product car designers try to lower the drag coefficient as much as possible, therefore lowering the drag force. Lower drag force also implies more fuel efficiency, which is very much preferred. Currently, Mercedes A-class Sedan, has the lowest drag coefficient of 0.22 in top speed mode. To reduce drag, the frontal area should also be lowered as much as possible, which in this case is 2.19 square metres. Damn, this makes Mercedes A-class Sedan so aerodynamic and can drove at high speeds. Now, you may wonder that F1 cars are highly aerodynamic as they move very fast, but unfortunately the drag coefficient is approximately 0.7 which is very high compared to 0.22. This is mainly due to the wings and uncovered wheels. It is desirable for F1 cars to have necessery down force which enables them to have higher cornering speeds and creates more grip. Drag is an unwanted byproduct of downforce.  

One way of increasing down force is by mounting wings at the rear side. According to Bernoulli’s Principle, fast moving liquids will have lower pressure than the slow moving. The same principle works here, when a car is moving at high speed, there is fast moving air at the lower surface of the wing than the upper surface, creating a downward force. The shape of the wing is of an inverted aerofoil, creating negative lift. The air flow over the car, follows the shape of the car when it flows, this creates a slight lift at the rear end, as the path of air flow lowers down. This can be reduced by spoiling the air flow by making use of spoilers. Spoilers are mounted at the back end, interferes the air flow by generating their own downward force. This baby spoiler tacked at the back gives high speed stability.

Now, there is lot of down force at the rear end. Most of the down force at the rear end can create understeer and nobody wants that. Then what about the front side to balance this out? This problem is solved by adding splitters. When a car is swimming in endless air ocean, a lot of air gets stacked up at the front side before following the shape of the car, creating a very high pressure area that makes the high pressure air flow under the car and generating the undesired lift. What does splitter to is that, it increases the area where the air is getting stacked, and hence reducing the pressure. Now low pressure air goes under the car and high pressure over the car, generating the desired down force at the front end. But in average daily driving basis which is mostly at lower speed comparatively, splitters are not much needed.
In the current scenario, the product car designers are still working on the modifications that can be made, to make the cars more aerodynamic and increase its stability. Making cars more aerodynamic implies reducing the tendency of accidents that can happen at higher speeds.
